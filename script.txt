Chloe: Hey! You'll never guess what I just heard.
Zoe: Ooh, tell me everything.
Chloe: It's about Liam's birthday.
Zoe: Don't tell me you forgot! It's next week!
Chloe: No, silly! I heard some people are planning a surprise party for him.
Zoe: What?! Who? We should be the ones to do that!
Chloe: I know, right? It's his sister, apparently.
Zoe: His sister? The one who lives out of town?
Chloe: Yep, that's the one. She's coming in just for the party.
Zoe: Wow, that's so sweet of her!
Chloe: I know! But I feel like we should still do something for him, just from us.
Zoe: Definitely! How about we take him out for that new ramen place he's been wanting to try?
Chloe: Perfect! It's a date. The three of us.
Zoe: Yay! Best friends forever.
Chloe: And ever! 😉
